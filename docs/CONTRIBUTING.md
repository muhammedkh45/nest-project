# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! A few quick guidelines to make collaboration smooth.

Git workflow

- Create branches from `master` with descriptive names: `feature/<name>`, `fix/<short-desc>`.
- Keep changes small and focused; one feature or fix per branch.

Commits & PRs

- Use clear commit messages, e.g., `feat(user): add registration endpoint`.
- Open a Pull Request and add a description of what you changed and why.
- Link related issue(s) in the PR description.

Style & tests

- Follow existing TypeScript and NestJS patterns found in the repo.
- Add tests for new or changed business logic where practical.

Review process

- A PR should have at least one approving review before merging.
- Rebase or merge latest `master` to resolve conflicts before final merge.
