# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the project maintainers instead of opening a public issue.

Recommended steps:

- Email the maintainer or repository owner with a clear description and steps to reproduce.
- Do not include sensitive data or exploit code in public issues.

Keep dependencies up-to-date and run `npm audit` periodically.
